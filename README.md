# 🧮 Math Adventures — AI-Powered Adaptive Learning Prototype

An AI-powered adaptive math learning prototype designed for children (ages 5–10).  
It helps learners practice basic math operations — addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division — while **dynamically adjusting the difficulty** based on performance.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To demonstrate how adaptive learning systems personalize educational content using simple machine learning logic.  
This prototype adjusts puzzle difficulty automatically to maintain an optimal challenge level for each learner.

---

## 🧠 Core Features
- **Four math operations**: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division  
- **Adaptive difficulty engine** using lightweight ML logic (logistic-style learning model)  
- **Automatic tracking** of correctness and performance  
- **Dynamic question generation** across 3 levels: Easy, Medium, Hard  
- **Session summary** showing accuracy and final level after 10 questions
